The objective is to model a damped simple pendulum and quantify the effects of uncertainty in its length through a probabilistic framework and Monte Carlo simulation.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

A simple damped pendulum is analyzed, considering uncertainty in its length \( L \), modeled as a Gamma-distributed random variable. The angular response \( \theta(t) \) is obtained via numerical integration of the linearized equation of motion, and statistical quantities of interest are computed from the ensemble of trajectories.
