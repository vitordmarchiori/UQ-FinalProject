The goal is to quantify the uncertainty propagation from an uncertain pendulum length to the dynamic response of the system.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

The physical system consists of a damped simple pendulum with uncertain length \( L \sim \text{Gamma}(\nu, \theta) \). The governing equation is derived and solved for multiple realizations using the Monte Carlo method.

## ðŸ“Š Requirements

* MATLAB R2021a or newer
* Toolboxes: `Statistics and Machine Learning`, `ODE`, `MATLAB Base`

## ðŸ”¬ Topics Covered

* Linearized dynamics
* Damped oscillator
* Gamma-distributed uncertainty
* Monte Carlo simulation
* Propagation of uncertainty
* Kernel density estimation
* Visualization of confidence bands
